Welcome to Random-ML's Documentation!
======================================

**`random-ml`** is a machine learning package focused on **randomized neural networks** and **functional link architectures**.
It includes **Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) networks**, ensemble learning techniques, and various randomized machine learning models.


What is Random-ML?
==================
Traditional neural networks rely on **gradient-based learning** for optimization.
However, randomized networks like **RVFL** use **fixed random weights** for hidden layers, allowing:
- **Faster Training** (no backpropagation)
- **Closed-Form Solutions** (Ridge Regression, Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse)
- **Good Generalization Performance**
